## Introduction

![](overview.png)

In a longitudinal clinical registry, different measurement instruments might have been used for assessing individuals at different time points. To combine them, we investigate deep learning techniques for obtaining a joint latent representation, to which the items of different measurement instruments are mapped. This corresponds to domain adaptation, an established concept in computer science for image data. 

Using our proposed approach as an example, we evaluate the potential of domain adaptation in a longitudinal cohort setting with a rather small number of time points, motivated by an application with different motor function measurement instruments in a registry of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) patients. We model trajectories in the latent representation by ordinary differential equations (ODEs), where person-specific ODE parameters are inferred from baseline characteristics. This is based on our previous work on ODEs for latent dynamic modeling of longitudinal data:

Biometrical Journal, 64, 1426â€“1445. :globe_with_meridians: [doi:10.1002/bimj](https://doi.org/10.1002/bimj.202000366); :computer: [DeepDynamicModelingWithJust2TimePoints](https://github.com/maren-ha/DeepDynamicModelingWithJust2TimePoints).

To systematically investigate the effect of differences between measurement instruments, we consider several scenarios based on modified SMA data with artificial discrepancies, including scenarios where a mapping should be feasible in principle and scenarios where no perfect mapping is available. We subsequently evaluate the approach on two measurement instruments from the SMA registry. 

Our results indicate that domain adaptation might be more generally useful in statistical modeling for longitudinal registry data.
